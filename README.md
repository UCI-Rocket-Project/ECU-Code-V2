The current Avionics system is divided into two contorllers being controlled by corresponding code. The first controller is located within a switchbox handling all switch inputs, digitizing switch signals, transmitting it to the engine controller, and receiving telemtry from the engine. This controller is referred to as the Control Unit (CU). The second controller is in charge of actually controlling engine solenoids and getting data from thermocouples. This unity is referred to as the Engine Control Unit (ECU).
